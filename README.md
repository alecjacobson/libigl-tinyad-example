# libigl ü§ù TinyAD

A small example project mixing [libigl](https://github.com/libigl/libigl/) and
[TinyAD](https://github.com/patr-schm/TinyAD).  Launches the libigl viewer while
in a separate thread optimizing an armadillo mesh's parametrization.

## Compile

Compile this project using the standard cmake routine:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

This should find and build the dependencies and create a `example` binary.

## Run

From within the `build` directory just issue:

    ./example

A glfw app should launch displaying an animating Armadillo parametrization.
